# HP-MDC - Hybrid Pattern Malware Detection and Categorization
HP-MDC is an Android Malware Detection (one of the classic pattern recognition issues) framework. It combines malwareâ€™s patterns from network traffic and code graph structure.

For the network traffic feature based module, we split the raw PCAP file to the network flow (groups network packet with a 5-tuple, the network flow should have the same (sourceID, sourcePort, destinationIP, destinationPort, Protocol)). And then we convert each network packet to a 784-byte gray image.  In our case, we refer to the Android Adware and General Malware Dataset (CIC-AAGM2017) https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/android-adware.html.

For the program code feature based module, we introduce natural language processing inspired methods in our malware detection and categorization framework.
